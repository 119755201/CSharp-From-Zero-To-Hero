  # The vision
"Programming is hard". Yes.But not harder than running a marathon for a person has never run. It's not harder than 
building a house if you never built one. Programming is hard only until you practice it (like any other skill). I would like to invite you to learn programming and C# following this course to practice programming and ignite passion for finding little miracles in code every day ðŸ™‚
