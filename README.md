## Chapter 1. Homework 3: Functions
### Intro
Variables and functions is what makes every single program. 
Understanding how to manage them, use and create your own functions is very important.
Code is a story that we, developers write. 
We start story from high level functions (title) and the more in depth we go, 
the lower such detailed code (content) ends up. 

### Task
Read name, surename, age, weight (in kg) and height (in cm) from console.  
1) Print all the info based on the example message below:  
``Tom Jefferson is 19 years old, his weight is 50 kg and his height is 156.5 cm.``  
2) Calculate and print body-mass index (BMI)  
3) Do 1 and 2 for another person.  

Try to use as many functions as you can, to split code in steps.  
Note: If you have done homework 1And2, create a new branch from it and refactor the code to use functions.
