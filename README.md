# C#: From Zero To Hero
## Chapter 1. Homework 9: Encoding and raw data

### Intro
#### Encoding
Encoding is key to having all kinds of symbols on different environments.
We have full freedom to typying our native language symbols, emojis or other special characters.
Ascii was the first standard for encoding characters that allowed an easy way of displayed text, especially on web.
However, standards changed and now we have Unicode- the ultimate standard for text encoding, enabling total a huge selection of characters.

#### Numeric systems
We, humans, try to make everything as simple as we can (or at least we used to).
The prime example of that is our main numerical system- decimal numbers- which is solely based on 10 fingers that we have.
It's important to understand, that the machine language is very different from human language.
Machines talk in binary nubmers (0 and 1) which has a base of 2 and not 10.
Machines don't talk in hexadecimal nubmers, but they are useful for us, programmers, to better, faster, understand the machine language.

### Task
#### Part 1
Make a program which has 2 conversion modes: 
From decimal to binary
From binary to decimal

#### Part 2
Use your WASD (both capital and non capital) keys to print arrows  
W- ↥  
A- ↤  
S- ↧  
D- ↦
