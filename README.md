# Homework 1And2

## Hints
* The tasks require you to have already created an account on GitHub. Do that first!
* Be very careful where to place your NewLine's and where not!
* Do use [CultureInfo.InvariantCulture](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo.invariantculture?view=netcore-3.1) when reading in float numbers. (Due to differences in parsing numbers with '.' and ',' character.
* The better your design, the easier it will be to find and fix errors!
* Be careful when it comes to the BMI. You have to use cm and m for the height.
* Do not hesitate to ask mentors for advice. This homework IS puzzling.
